Here's an example of how the API call might look like in JSON format:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "groups": [
            {
                "code": "10",
                "name": "SPECIAL DRINK",
                "parent": "1"
            },
            {
            [Redacted Content]
            },
            {
            [Redacted Content]
            },
            {
            [Redacted Content]
            }
        ]
    }


Example of API call request using cURL (JSON). To avoid HTTP 100 Continue, please specify "Expect:" as a header.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: token example-store-token" -H "Expect:" https://host.com/api/store/orders/complete -i -d '{ "order": "FR9TL74P" }'
    
Response
----------

Complete Order changes the :code:`"paymentStatus"` field to 2 (paid), :code:`"status"` field to 20 (complete) and the :code:`"statusText"` field to "Complete" regardless of the values within the fields beforehand except for the condition(s) below.

If an order is already complete or cancelled, the API call will return an error response stating that.

In response to these API calls, Omni will reply with the following data in JSON:

=================== ==================

=================== ==================
id                  Order ID
number              Order number string

grandTotal          Total value after tax, service charge, delivery fee, discount and promotion

notes               Customer notes string (example: no lettuce)
status              An int representing the order status ID

=================== ==================

Depending on the request, responses may return these status codes:

=================== ==============================
Code                Description
=================== ==============================
200                 Everything worked as expected
400                 Bad Request, usually missing a required parameter
401                 Unauthorized, usually missing or wrong authentication token
403                 Forbidden â€“ You do not have permission for this request
405                 HTTP method not allowed
500, 502, 503, 504  Something went wrong on Omni's end
